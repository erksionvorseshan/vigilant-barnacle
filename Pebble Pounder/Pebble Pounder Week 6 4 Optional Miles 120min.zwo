    <description>Today should ideally be done outdoors on your gravel bike. Aim to practice your bike handling skills, navigating around and over obstacles, and getting a feel for how different surfaces react. Otherwise, doing this ride on Zwift in the form of an unstructured endurance ride, or joining a group ride is perfect!.</description>
