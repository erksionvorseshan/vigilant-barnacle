# Zwift training plan workout files

Zwift's training plans are great, but they are very inflexible in what order you can complete them. We've all been there:
 - you had to miss a workout because of Thanksgiving
 - you felt so strong, that you wanted to do two sessions on the same day
 - you wanted to skip a few steps back or ahead

Zwift doesn't give you the option to redo a missed workout, or skip the mandatory rest period. This repository contains all the workouts from every training plan to help you choose which one you want to ride.

## About the repo

The workouts are sorted into their training plans' folders. They've been recreated from Zwift and other sources manually one-by-one. The only thing missing from them are the text messages that appear on screen during your ride. Don't worry though, those don't increase your FTP one bit.

## How to use

Just download any number of .zwo files and place them in your Zwift custom workouts folder which can be found at:  
`Documents/Zwift/Workouts/{Your Zwift ID}`  
Afterwards they'll appear in your workouts menu under "Custom Workouts".
