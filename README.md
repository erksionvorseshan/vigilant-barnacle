# Zwift training plan workout files

Zwift's training plans are great, but they are very inflexible in what order you can complete them. We've all been there:
 - you had to miss a workout because of Thanksgiving
 - you felt so strong, that you wanted to do two sessions on the same day
 - you wanted to skip a few steps back or ahead

Zwift doesn't really seem to care about the user experience of their software and rather chooses to reassure us time and time again, that yes: Tour de France winners are using their platform. And they're probably annoyed by the bugs too. Like the whole program quits when you save your workout, that's really refined.

## This repository

Here you'll find all the workouts from all the bike training plans sorted into folders. They've been copied from Zwift and other sources manually one-by-one. The only thing missing from them are the text messages that appear on screen during your ride. But don't worry, those probably don't increase your FTP one bit.
