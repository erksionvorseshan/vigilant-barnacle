    <description>This workout is made up of 5 efforts - one in each power zone from 2 to 6. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as the power increases, the length of each effort decreases. The focus of this workout is the continuation of the high cadence work, where we complete the first 4 efforts at 105rpm. Remember - if you can train yourself to produce high power at a high cadence, you pedaling efficiency will improve at your â€˜go-to' cadence, which may even nudge up a little!</description>
